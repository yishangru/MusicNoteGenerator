Auto Generate Plain Music Sheet

This is an idea to auto generate music sheet with audio as input. We plan to make a demo on this winter holiday.

## General Plan
1. Find methods to separate notes with paragraph and separator from audio.
2. Identify the intonation of note and relative length (beat) of notes.
3. Generate music sheet with API calls.
